# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

<PersonalizeContentButton />
<TranslateToUrduButton />

This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action systems that enable humanoid robots to understand and respond to natural language commands through multimodal AI systems.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper for command recognition
- Develop cognitive planning systems that translate natural language into ROS 2 actions
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems for complete VLA capabilities
- Create conversational robotics interfaces using GPT models
- Execute multi-step tasks autonomously based on natural language instructions

## Module Structure
- Week 10: Voice-to-Action Systems with OpenAI Whisper
- Week 11: Cognitive Planning and Natural Language Processing
- Week 12: Vision-Language-Action Integration
- Week 13: Capstone Project - Autonomous Humanoid Tasks

## Prerequisites
- All previous modules completion
- Understanding of NLP and computer vision concepts
- Access to RTX-enabled hardware for AI processing

## Next Steps
After completing this module, you'll have built a complete humanoid robot system capable of understanding natural language commands and executing complex multi-step tasks autonomously.
