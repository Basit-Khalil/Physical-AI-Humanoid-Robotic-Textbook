## Understanding ROS 2 Fundamentals

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms. In the context of humanoid robotics, ROS 2 serves as the communication backbone that allows different components of the robot to work together seamlessly.

### Key Concepts in ROS 2

1.  **Nodes:** A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes. In humanoid robotics, different nodes might handle perception, planning, control, or hardware interfaces.

2.  **Topics:** Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. They enable asynchronous communication between nodes using a publish/subscribe model.

3.  **Services:** Services provide synchronous request/response communication between nodes, useful for operations that require a direct response.

4.  **Actions:** Actions are like services but for long-running tasks that may include feedback and the ability to cancel.

5.  **Packages:** A package is the smallest unit of organization in ROS 2, containing nodes, libraries, and other resources.

### ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 uses a distributed architecture where nodes can run on different machines and communicate over a network. It implements the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard for communication, which provides:

- Discovery: Nodes automatically find each other on the network
- Communication: Reliable message passing between nodes
- Quality of Service (QoS): Configurable policies for message delivery

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Understand the distributed architecture of ROS 2
- Identify the role of DDS in ROS 2 communication
- Describe how ROS 2 enables communication in humanoid robot systems

## Practical Tasks
- Install ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later) on your development machine
- Create a simple ROS 2 workspace and package
- Run the basic ROS 2 tutorials to understand nodes and topics
