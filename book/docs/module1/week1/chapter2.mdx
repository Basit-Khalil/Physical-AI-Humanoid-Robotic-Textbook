## Understanding Robot Sensors and Actuators

In Physical AI and humanoid robotics, sensors and actuators form the critical interface between the AI system and the physical world. Sensors provide the robot with information about its environment and internal state, while actuators enable the robot to interact with and modify its environment.

### Types of Sensors in Humanoid Robotics

1.  **Proprioceptive Sensors:** These sensors provide information about the robot's internal state, including joint angles, motor positions, velocities, and torques. Examples include encoders, potentiometers, and current sensors.

2.  **Exteroceptive Sensors:** These sensors provide information about the external environment. Key types include:
    - Vision systems (cameras, stereo vision)
    - Range sensors (LiDAR, ultrasonic, infrared)
    - Tactile sensors (force/torque sensors, touch sensors)
    - Auditory sensors (microphones)

3.  **Inertial Sensors:** These provide information about the robot's motion and orientation in space. Examples include Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), accelerometers, and gyroscopes.

### Actuators in Humanoid Systems

Actuators are the components that enable the robot to perform physical actions. In humanoid robots, these typically include:
- Servo motors for precise joint control
- Linear actuators for specific movements
- Pneumatic or hydraulic systems for powerful actuation
- Specialized end-effectors (hands, grippers)

### The Role of Embodied Cognition

Embodied cognition is a theoretical framework that emphasizes the role of an organism's (or robot's) body in shaping its cognitive processes. In humanoid robotics, this means that cognitive processes cannot be fully understood without considering:
- The physical form and its constraints
- The sensorimotor interactions with the environment
- The role of action in perception and learning

This approach contrasts with traditional AI that treats cognition as abstract symbol manipulation, separate from the physical body.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify different types of sensors used in humanoid robotics
- Understand the role of actuators in robot behavior
- Explain the concept of embodied cognition and its importance in Physical AI
- Analyze the relationship between sensorimotor interactions and cognitive processes

## Practical Tasks
- Research and document the sensor suite of a specific humanoid robot (e.g., Boston Dynamics Atlas, Honda ASIMO, or similar)
- Create a diagram showing the sensorimotor pathways in a simple robot system
