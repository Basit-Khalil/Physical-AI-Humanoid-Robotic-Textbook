## What is Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional artificial intelligence that operates primarily in digital environments to AI systems that interact with and operate within the physical world. Unlike conventional AI that processes data in abstract computational spaces, Physical AI is fundamentally integrated with physical systems—robots, sensors, actuators, and real-world environments—to perform tasks that require understanding and manipulation of the physical world.

Embodied Intelligence is a core concept within Physical AI that emphasizes the role of a physical body in cognitive processes. Rather than treating intelligence as purely algorithmic, embodied intelligence recognizes that the physical form and its interactions with the environment are essential to intelligent behavior. This perspective draws from biological systems where the body and brain co-evolved, with the body serving as both a sensor and actuator that shapes cognitive processes.

### Core Principles of Physical AI

1.  **Embodiment:** Intelligence emerges from the interaction between the agent and its environment. The physical form, sensors, and actuators are integral to cognitive processes rather than mere input/output channels.

2.  **Sensorimotor Integration:** Physical AI systems tightly couple perception (sensory input) with action (motor output). This closed-loop interaction enables adaptive behavior and learning through environmental interaction.

3.  **Real-time Processing:** Physical AI systems must operate in real-time to respond to dynamic environments. This requires efficient algorithms and specialized hardware to handle the continuous stream of sensor data and generate appropriate motor commands.

4.  **Environmental Affordances:** The system must understand what actions are possible in its environment (affordances) and how its actions affect the environment. This includes understanding physics, materials, and spatial relationships.

5.  **Adaptive Learning:** Physical AI systems learn through interaction with the physical world, refining their understanding and behavior based on sensory feedback and task outcomes.

6.  **Multimodal Perception:** Physical AI systems integrate multiple sensory modalities (vision, touch, proprioception, audition) to build a comprehensive understanding of their environment.
