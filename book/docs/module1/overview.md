# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

<PersonalizeContentButton />
<TranslateToUrduButton />

This module introduces ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the foundational communication framework for humanoid robots. ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" that allows different components of a robot to communicate effectively, enabling coordinated behavior and control.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 and its architecture
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for robot control
- Implement topics, services, and actions for robot communication
- Integrate Python agents with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Define robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Module Structure
- Week 1: Introduction to ROS 2 and Physical AI
- Week 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Week 3: Python Agents Integration with rclpy

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of robot kinematics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Next Steps
After completing this module, you'll have the foundational knowledge to build communication networks between different components of your humanoid robot, preparing you for simulation and AI integration in subsequent modules.
